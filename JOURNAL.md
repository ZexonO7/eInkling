## 11/4/2025 6:16 PM - the Idea ✨✨  

so I'm building something called einking
the idea hit randomly and it just clicked
what if e ink wasn’t just for kindles but for everything you actually wanna see every day
notes weather grocery list random thoughts
a quiet digital paper board that just exists on your desk

we’re going for calm tech
something warm and simple that feels like paper but thinks like a computer
no flashy screens no distractions just clean monochrome peace

it’s just the start but we’re building it for real now
and it already feels like it’s gonna be something special 🩶

somethin like dis image, but a "bit" more crazyy ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e6611da85ea0d71b5ad7e7ee15fb23d96b911ab3/image.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 6:53 PM - turning Idea into hardwaree   

Alsoo, I spent like the whole day yesterday deep-diving into how to actually build this thing
the idea’s starting to turn into real parts and circuits now

we’re going with a **raspberry pi 4** as the brain — it’s perfect
fast enough to handle weather, notes, maybe even a lil web panel later
and it keeps that “tiny desk computer” vibe i wanted

- the display’s a 5-inch 7 color e-ink panel, found one for about $60
sharp, calm, and exactly the kind of screen that makes tech feel slow in a good way

did a ton of research on what else we’ll need too:

- a 32gb sd card for the os
- 5v 3a usb-c power supply
- Jumper cables
- some jumper wires to connect the display
- a 3d printed small enclosure, maybe wooden or matte acrylic, to keep it cozy
- heatsinks if it gets warm (the pi can be dramatic sometimes)

so far the setup cost’s sitting around $130-ish total, which honestly feels worth it
next step’s figuring out the software flow — how the pi’ll talk to the display
and how we’ll make those clean lil “cards” for notes, weather, quotes, all that

it’s finally starting to feel like something we can build for real 🩶
