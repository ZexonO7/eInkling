## 11/4/2025 6:16 PM - the Idea ✨✨  

so I'm building something called einking
the idea hit randomly and it just clicked
what if e ink wasn’t just for kindles but for everything you actually wanna see every day
notes weather grocery list random thoughts
a quiet digital paper board that just exists on your desk

we’re going for calm tech
something warm and simple that feels like paper but thinks like a computer
no flashy screens no distractions just clean monochrome peace

it’s just the start but we’re building it for real now
and it already feels like it’s gonna be something special 🩶

somethin like dis image, but a "bit" more crazyy ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e6611da85ea0d71b5ad7e7ee15fb23d96b911ab3/image.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 6:53 PM - turning Idea into hardwaree   

Alsoo, I spent like the whole day yesterday deep-diving into how to actually build this thing
the idea’s starting to turn into real parts and circuits now

we’re going with a **raspberry pi 4** as the brain — it’s perfect
fast enough to handle weather, notes, maybe even a lil web panel later
and it keeps that “tiny desk computer” vibe i wanted

- the display’s a 5-inch 7 color e-ink panel, found one for about $60
sharp, calm, and exactly the kind of screen that makes tech feel slow in a good way

did a ton of research on what else we’ll need too:

- a 32gb sd card for the os
- 5v 3a usb-c power supply
- Jumper cables
- some jumper wires to connect the display
- a 3d printed small enclosure, maybe wooden or matte acrylic, to keep it cozy
- heatsinks if it gets warm (the pi can be dramatic sometimes)

so far the setup cost’s sitting around $130-ish total, which honestly feels worth it
next step’s figuring out the software flow — how the pi’ll talk to the display
and how we’ll make those clean lil “cards” for notes, weather, quotes, all that

it’s finally starting to feel like something we can build for real 🩶

## 11/4/2025 7 PM - designin the shells  

today was all about the inside of the build
specifically how the raspberry pi will sit and breathe inside the case

not touching the outside yet just the little frame that holds the pi cleanly behind the e ink display
no dangling wires no chaos just calm tidy internals

started sketching a small backplate that the pi screws into with neat little slots for
usb c power on the side
a small hdmi and debug port for setup
and two tiny leds on the front one for power and one for activity

the plan is to make the pi kind of float behind the screen using brass standoffs
cables will slide through a small channel that hides them completely
might even add a magnetic back lid so it’s easy to open later if needed

next up i’ll model the actual case for the display on openspace, alsoo made like an image wat I want it to kinda look likee 
just a clean backplate with posts for the pi and cable grooves that match the board layout
once printed it should snap right into the shell

the inside’s finally starting to make sense now 🩶

## 11/4/2025 8 PM - The codeee  

spent the day reading through all the code and honestly it’s starting to feel neat
everything has its place and moves like clockwork

the whole thing begins with run.py
it’s basically the heart that starts the flask app
that app isn’t just for editing notes and todos — it’s also what keeps the background refresh loop alive

the refresh loop lives in app.py
it runs quietly in a separate thread
every few minutes it calls the renderer
the renderer’s job is to build the actual image that’ll go on the e ink screen

the renderer.py file is where the magic happens
it creates a blank image using pillow and then calls a bunch of tiny modules called cards
each card draws a piece of the dashboard
they all get drawn in their own little rectangles
when everything’s done the renderer sends the full image to eink.py

that file decides where the frame goes
if we’re in simulator mode it just saves it as a png in the out folder
if we’re in waveshare mode it sends it to the actual e ink panel through spi
so it’s the switch that decides if we’re testing or showing for real

data lives inside the data folder
just simple json files like notes.json and todos.json
whenever you add or remove things on the web panel the flask app updates those files
then on the next refresh the new info gets drawn on the screen

the fonts the layout the spacing all come from the little utils in utils
they make sure everything looks balanced and not cramped

and that’s the whole rhythm of einking
collect
render
display
sleep
repeat

it’s small and quiet but everything inside works together perfectly
like a calm machine that only wakes up to show you something you care about 🩶

## 11/5/2025 12 AM - well.. had to budgett  

well.. had to budget and it was rough
budgeting sounded simple but turning einking into something affordable almost broke my brain

the goal was simple get einking closer to 50 dollars without losing the calm vibe

the raspberry pi setup was running perfectly
but every time i added up the numbers it felt wrong
too expensive too overpowered for what we’re trying to build
it’s supposed to be calm tech not a tech flex

so i started tearing it all apart
looking for something smaller cheaper but still alive enough to run the whole thing
that’s when i landed on the esp32

picked a small set of libraries planned memory carefully kept fonts simple
designed the render to be predictable so the layout never feels crowded
kept data local and light so updates feel instant when they happen

the result from 160ish lands near 65 dollars and still feels like einking
same slow energy same warm monochrome just smarter with parts and power

hard in the way that makes a project sharper
less noise more intention 🩶

## 11/5/2025 1 AM - makin the esp32 case  

spent like 2ish hrs in onshape building the new case for the esp32 version
the goal was to keep the same calm shape and energy of einking but make it fit a smaller quieter board

the esp changed the whole layout
the pi case had room for ports fans cables all that extra space
this one had to be tighter cleaner almost invisible
so i started over
a frame that wraps perfectly around the e ink display with just enough room behind it for the esp32 to rest

onshape took patience
lots of small details to get right
a slot for the usb port
and a led peekin through
asloo it has the name on it

the case is a one piece
the front plate holds the screen like a page
the back plate clips in smoothly with the back
no screws showing no sharp corners
just a soft edge all around

the esp sits in the back
everything routes neatly to the display header
it feels solid but light like a mix of craft and tech

it’s still a digital model but looking at it in onshape already feels satisfying
simple minimal warm
exactly how einking should feel when it finally sits on a desk 🩶

![Screenshot 2025-11-05 005258](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM2OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--90b231b81c2614464257a9fc027c79d97d575de3/Screenshot%202025-11-05%20005258.png)
  

## 11/5/2025 4 AM - attempt to the assemblyy..  

this was the longest build session yet
spent hours in onshape trying to get the esp32 case assembly right and even though it looks simple it took forever to make everything align the way i imagined it

the case is a single piece now
the screen fits into the front panel  and the esp32 sits behind it perfectly
but getting there meant rethinking the layout over and over
the usb port had to line up cleanly
the mounting space for the e ink had to stay thin without breaking the structure
and all of it had to feel calm and balanced not like a box with electronics shoved inside

i’m still new to cad so most of it was trial and error
lots of tiny adjustments
moving a part by a millimeter then realizing it broke another mate
the esp module kept floating until i finally figured out how to anchor it
but seeing it all snap together in the end felt so good

now the assembly finally looks like something real
the display rests in the frame
the esp sits tucked behind with a couple of screws and breathing space
everything’s aligned and clean from every angle

it’s one solid shell that holds everything together quietly
simple soft balanced
took longer than it should have but i learned more about cad in this one project than in weeks before

the best part is seeing it in 3d and realizing
yeah this could actually sit on a desk and just be einking 🩶

It would a lott better when its **actually** madee
alsoo the displays a bit smaller in the modell..

## 11/5/2025 11 AM - fixin the repo + assemblyy   

the repo was starting to look cluttered
old pi files mixed with the esp32 build and random exports from onshape
so i spent the day sorting it all out and giving it some proper structure

added all the parts from the assembly into the repo
organized the folders so the 3d models live in a hardware section
and the dev logs sit neatly inside docs
the code base finally feels like one connected thing instead of scattered pieces

updated the readme too
it finally sounds like einking
added notes about the esp32 version the case design and what’s changed since the early builds
fixed the layout cleaned the formatting and made it easier to follow for anyone reading through

it took a while but now the repo feels alive
like it belongs to a real project not just an idea being tested
everything fits together clearly and calmly
it’s quiet organization but it changed everything
einking’s starting to look finished from the inside out 🩶

## 11/6/2025 8 PM - updatin the 3d assemblyy  

spent almost four hours in onshape today
it doesn’t look like a big change at first glance but this update took actual real patience

the earlier version felt rough and loose
the display sat slightly off center
the esp mount wasn’t snug and the usb cutout didn’t line up with the shell anymore
alsoo, where wasent a full casee
soo i rebuilt the placement for every single part until everything sat exactly where it should

the case is still a single solid body but now it feels tighter and more designed
the esp32 board fits neatly into its space with just enough clearance for the port and the headers
the e ink display rests flush in the front window with perfect depth
and the routing behind it finally looks intentional instead of squeezed in

being new to cad makes everything take twice as long
half the time was just learning better ways to constrain and align things
but this session felt different
it stopped being just experimenting and started feeling like real design work

the updated model looks clean balanced and more product like
nothing feels random anymore
it’s one smooth continuous shell holding everything with quiet precision
this version finally feels ready to printt 🩶

## 11/6/2025 9 PM - fixin the overlappins in the assemblyy  

spent some timee on fixin the overlapping parts in the case model
it looked fine from a distance but once i started checking closely a few faces were cutting into each other and it was breaking the flow of the design

the esp mount was slightly colliding with the back wall and the display pocket was just a little too deep
tiny errors that made everything feel off when you zoomed in
so i went back and adjusted every offset until the geometry was clean and nothing touched where it shouldn’t

after fixing that i decided to add some color
went with a royal green finish
it changed everything
the model suddenly felt premium but still calm
not bright or flashy just rich and grounded

the color made the soft edges stand out and the frame look more intentional
it almost looks like a finished product now instead of a cad sketch

took time but now the model feels balanced
no overlaps no weird shadows just smooth clean surfaces
and the royal green gives it that quiet elegance einking’s always been about 🩶

## 11/7/2025 - pushin the budgett.. lower..  

pushin the budget even lower
spent almost three ishh hours reworking every part of the build to see how far i could bring the cost down without breaking what makes einking feel calm and complete

the goal was to get it under fifty dollars and it actually worked
swapped out the expensive wooden frame for a simpler printed shell made from a cheaper "picture" filament
it doesn’t look as warm but it still keeps that soft shape and minimal feel

found a cheaper e ink display too
smaller and slower but still clear enough for the layout
had to adjust the model dimensions slightly but it fits and runs fine with the esp32
it feels more compact now less like a showpiece more like something small and thoughtful that just sits quietly on your desk

dropped the sd card completely
the esp’s integrated storage turned out to be enough once the code was cleaned up
no external wiring no extra parts

three hours of spreadsheets measurements and tweaking later it workss
still does everything the same just lighter cheaper and simpler

the tradeoffs were worth it
it feels lean and efficient without losing the quiet personality that einking always had 🩶

## 11/9/2025 - makin it complexx  

spent around four hours today making einking a little more alive
it started simple just code and a calm case but i wanted it to feel more like an actual object you could use not just look at

added side buttons to the new model
tiny round tactile ones recessed into the right edge of the shell
one for manual refresh one for switching between layouts and one that cycles through quotes or messages
getting them placed right took forever because every little change shifted the shell thickness and cable paths inside
but when it finally lined up the whole thing felt more complete

also added a li-ion 4.2v battery so it can run untethered
no cables hanging out just quiet independence
had to carve a small compartment in the back of the case for the cell and route the wires around the esp board without crowding it
the balance between space weight and shape took most of the time

and then built a matching case to hold everything together
kept the soft edges and that royal green tone
but added a smooth cutout along the right side for the buttons
it looks more intentional now less like a prototype more like a finished device

the inside is packed tighter than before but it works
esp32 mount battery pocket button slots everything fits like a puzzle
took four hours but now it feels like the project finally grew up

einking isn’t just quiet tech anymore
it’s a small calm machine that actually listens to you 🩶
