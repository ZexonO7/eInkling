## 11/4/2025 6:16 PM - the Idea ✨✨  

so I'm building something called einking
the idea hit randomly and it just clicked
what if e ink wasn’t just for kindles but for everything you actually wanna see every day
notes weather grocery list random thoughts
a quiet digital paper board that just exists on your desk

we’re going for calm tech
something warm and simple that feels like paper but thinks like a computer
no flashy screens no distractions just clean monochrome peace

it’s just the start but we’re building it for real now
and it already feels like it’s gonna be something special 🩶

somethin like dis image, but a "bit" more crazyy ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e6611da85ea0d71b5ad7e7ee15fb23d96b911ab3/image.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 6:53 PM - turning Idea into hardwaree   

Alsoo, I spent like the whole day yesterday deep-diving into how to actually build this thing
the idea’s starting to turn into real parts and circuits now

we’re going with a **raspberry pi 4** as the brain — it’s perfect
fast enough to handle weather, notes, maybe even a lil web panel later
and it keeps that “tiny desk computer” vibe i wanted

- the display’s a 5-inch 7 color e-ink panel, found one for about $60
sharp, calm, and exactly the kind of screen that makes tech feel slow in a good way

did a ton of research on what else we’ll need too:

- a 32gb sd card for the os
- 5v 3a usb-c power supply
- Jumper cables
- some jumper wires to connect the display
- a 3d printed small enclosure, maybe wooden or matte acrylic, to keep it cozy
- heatsinks if it gets warm (the pi can be dramatic sometimes)

so far the setup cost’s sitting around $130-ish total, which honestly feels worth it
next step’s figuring out the software flow — how the pi’ll talk to the display
and how we’ll make those clean lil “cards” for notes, weather, quotes, all that

it’s finally starting to feel like something we can build for real 🩶

## 11/4/2025 7 PM - designin the shells  

today was all about the inside of the build
specifically how the raspberry pi will sit and breathe inside the case

not touching the outside yet just the little frame that holds the pi cleanly behind the e ink display
no dangling wires no chaos just calm tidy internals

started sketching a small backplate that the pi screws into with neat little slots for
usb c power on the side
a small hdmi and debug port for setup
and two tiny leds on the front one for power and one for activity

the plan is to make the pi kind of float behind the screen using brass standoffs
cables will slide through a small channel that hides them completely
might even add a magnetic back lid so it’s easy to open later if needed

next up i’ll model the actual case for the display on openspace, alsoo made like an image wat I want it to kinda look likee 
just a clean backplate with posts for the pi and cable grooves that match the board layout
once printed it should snap right into the shell

the inside’s finally starting to make sense now 🩶

## 11/4/2025 8 PM - The codeee  

spent the day reading through all the code and honestly it’s starting to feel neat
everything has its place and moves like clockwork

the whole thing begins with run.py
it’s basically the heart that starts the flask app
that app isn’t just for editing notes and todos — it’s also what keeps the background refresh loop alive

the refresh loop lives in app.py
it runs quietly in a separate thread
every few minutes it calls the renderer
the renderer’s job is to build the actual image that’ll go on the e ink screen

the renderer.py file is where the magic happens
it creates a blank image using pillow and then calls a bunch of tiny modules called cards
each card draws a piece of the dashboard
they all get drawn in their own little rectangles
when everything’s done the renderer sends the full image to eink.py

that file decides where the frame goes
if we’re in simulator mode it just saves it as a png in the out folder
if we’re in waveshare mode it sends it to the actual e ink panel through spi
so it’s the switch that decides if we’re testing or showing for real

data lives inside the data folder
just simple json files like notes.json and todos.json
whenever you add or remove things on the web panel the flask app updates those files
then on the next refresh the new info gets drawn on the screen

the fonts the layout the spacing all come from the little utils in utils
they make sure everything looks balanced and not cramped

and that’s the whole rhythm of einking
collect
render
display
sleep
repeat

it’s small and quiet but everything inside works together perfectly
like a calm machine that only wakes up to show you something you care about 🩶

## 11/5/2025 - well.. had to budgett  

well.. had to budget and it was rough
budgeting sounded simple but turning einking into something affordable almost broke my brain

the goal was simple get einking closer to 50 dollars without losing the calm vibe

the raspberry pi setup was running perfectly
but every time i added up the numbers it felt wrong
too expensive too overpowered for what we’re trying to build
it’s supposed to be calm tech not a tech flex

so i started tearing it all apart
looking for something smaller cheaper but still alive enough to run the whole thing
that’s when i landed on the esp32

picked a small set of libraries planned memory carefully kept fonts simple
designed the render to be predictable so the layout never feels crowded
kept data local and light so updates feel instant when they happen

the result from 160ish lands near 65 dollars and still feels like einking
same slow energy same warm monochrome just smarter with parts and power

hard in the way that makes a project sharper
less noise more intention 🩶
