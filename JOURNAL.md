## 11/4/2025 - the Idea ✨✨  

so I'm building something called einking
the idea hit randomly and it just clicked
what if e ink wasn’t just for kindles but for everything you actually wanna see every day
notes weather grocery list random thoughts
a quiet digital paper board that just exists on your desk

we’re going for calm tech
something warm and simple that feels like paper but thinks like a computer
no flashy screens no distractions just clean monochrome peace

it’s just the start but we’re building it for real now
and it already feels like it’s gonna be something special 🩶

somethin like dis image, but a "bit" more crazyy ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e6611da85ea0d71b5ad7e7ee15fb23d96b911ab3/image.png)
